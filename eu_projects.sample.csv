170;Fresh seafood promotion: festival, campaign and seminars;<p>The Larnaca and Famagusta fisheries local action group (FLAG) in Cyprus wanted to promote fresh seafood and so embarked upon a series of events and promotional activities, reaching thousands of people and encouraging them to eat seafood and learn more about local fisheries and aquaculture.</p>;CY;Education & training
175;Master-apprentice programme: supporting fishing start-ups for the young;<p>Thanks to the combination of an apprenticeship project for young fishers and support from an EU-funded fisheries local action group (FLAG) to improve a local fishing business, Tanja Åkerfelt is now a successful fisherwoman and entrepreneur, selling her fresh and processed produce directly to consumers. The training allowed her to learn fishing and processing techniques in a practical, 'on the job' environment. She also learnt about fishing vessels and received support to identify specific development needs for her father's company that she planned to take over.</p>;FI;Education & training
185;Fisheries, angling and education: reviving a rural lake area;<p>Initiated by a local angling and tourism organisation, this project aims to revitalise the area around Lake Burtnieku which has a large but unexploited fishing potential, and to raise awareness about fishing, angling, health and the environment. The Association 'Burtnieku Angling and Tourism School' manages the angling and recreation centre offering equipment rental, accommodation and attractions for tourists. It also organises events around angling to educate young people and promote the area.</p>;LV;Education & training
484;Cooperation Project on Strengthening EU's Nordic Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) modules;<p>This EU-NU project supports and complements efforts made by Finland and Sweden in the field of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) in cold conditions and thus facilitates reinforced cooperation between the two countries in the field of preparedness in civil protection. The objective of this action is to contribute to developing USAR activities in the region in order to create a joint Nordic USAR team, which would be capable of operating in cold conditions and to share this knowledge wider within the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.</p>;FI;Environment & climate
486;Improving Preparedness to Face Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) Pollution of the Marine System;<p>The HNS-MS project is designed to develop a decision-support tool to help coastguard operators to better evaluate the consequence of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) pollution occurring in the 'Bonn Agreement area' and in the Bay of Biscay between France and Spain.</p>;BE;Environment & climate
601;Boat shop: fresh fish in the city centre;<p>With the help of the fisheries local action group (FLAG), the Thorup beach fishermen's guild converted a traditional fishing boat into a floating fish shop moored in the heart of Copenhagen. This gives the fishing guild's products a special entry point to the Danish capital's affluent market. The fish is some of the freshest you can find in the capital, as the boats only work daily trips. The guild has hired a chef to manage the shop, which in addition to whole fresh fish also offers fillets, fresh fish burgers and other small dishes prepared in the guild's processing plant.</p>;DK;Business
609;Local seafood in Portugal: short circuits and sustainability;<p>Through the development of an innovative short supply chain delivery system of local seafood, the EU has helped a Portuguese company to bridge the gap between customers and small-scale fishermen, whilst also encouraging sustainable fishing practices (certified by a label) in the Sesimbra area. Households and local organic stores can order local fish online at a specially designed website and <em>Fixe em Casa</em> will collect orders, liaise with the fishermen to purchase the fish in the Sesimbra auction and deliver it.</p>;PT;Business
610;Vianapesca: successful product placement;<p>Vianapesca, a producer organisation (PO) of small-scale and medium-sized fishing fleet operators from Northern Portugal, developed a marketing campaign to promote traditional seafood at national and European level. In 2013, in partnership with other Portuguese POs, Vianapesca opened a traditional canned fish store selling a range of local products in Lisbon. The following year, their Portuguese canned fish found its way to a gourmet grocery in Paris. These successes help to increase incomes and improve living conditions in Portugal's traditional fishing communities.</p>;PT;Business
