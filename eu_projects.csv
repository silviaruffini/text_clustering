170;Fresh seafood promotion: festival, campaign and seminars;<p>The Larnaca and Famagusta fisheries local action group (FLAG) in Cyprus wanted to promote fresh seafood and so embarked upon a series of events and promotional activities, reaching thousands of people and encouraging them to eat seafood and learn more about local fisheries and aquaculture.</p>;CY;Education & training
172;Put 'n' take angling;<p>This 'put and take' fishery offers an easy way for families and friends to experience Danish sea fishing in a safe and accessible environment where, in addition, the catch is guaranteed. This innovative activity has improved the area's tourist offers while creating a new market for local fish via a unique collaboration between a local aquarium, a fishmonger and local fishermen.</p>;DK;Education & training
175;Master-apprentice programme: supporting fishing start-ups for the young;<p>Thanks to the combination of an apprenticeship project for young fishers and support from an EU-funded fisheries local action group (FLAG) to improve a local fishing business, Tanja Åkerfelt is now a successful fisherwoman and entrepreneur, selling her fresh and processed produce directly to consumers. The training allowed her to learn fishing and processing techniques in a practical, 'on the job' environment. She also learnt about fishing vessels and received support to identify specific development needs for her father's company that she planned to take over.</p>;FI;Education & training
185;Fisheries, angling and education: reviving a rural lake area;<p>Initiated by a local angling and tourism organisation, this project aims to revitalise the area around Lake Burtnieku which has a large but unexploited fishing potential, and to raise awareness about fishing, angling, health and the environment. The Association 'Burtnieku Angling and Tourism School' manages the angling and recreation centre offering equipment rental, accommodation and attractions for tourists. It also organises events around angling to educate young people and promote the area.</p>;LV;Education & training
484;Cooperation Project on Strengthening EU's Nordic Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) modules;<p>This EU-NU project supports and complements efforts made by Finland and Sweden in the field of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) in cold conditions and thus facilitates reinforced cooperation between the two countries in the field of preparedness in civil protection. The objective of this action is to contribute to developing USAR activities in the region in order to create a joint Nordic USAR team, which would be capable of operating in cold conditions and to share this knowledge wider within the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.</p>;FI;Environment & climate
486;Improving Preparedness to Face Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) Pollution of the Marine System;<p>The HNS-MS project is designed to develop a decision-support tool to help coastguard operators to better evaluate the consequence of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) pollution occurring in the 'Bonn Agreement area' and in the Bay of Biscay between France and Spain.</p>;BE;Environment & climate
601;Boat shop: fresh fish in the city centre;<p>With the help of the fisheries local action group (FLAG), the Thorup beach fishermen's guild converted a traditional fishing boat into a floating fish shop moored in the heart of Copenhagen. This gives the fishing guild's products a special entry point to the Danish capital's affluent market. The fish is some of the freshest you can find in the capital, as the boats only work daily trips. The guild has hired a chef to manage the shop, which in addition to whole fresh fish also offers fillets, fresh fish burgers and other small dishes prepared in the guild's processing plant.</p>;DK;Business
609;Local seafood in Portugal: short circuits and sustainability;<p>Through the development of an innovative short supply chain delivery system of local seafood, the EU has helped a Portuguese company to bridge the gap between customers and small-scale fishermen, whilst also encouraging sustainable fishing practices (certified by a label) in the Sesimbra area. Households and local organic stores can order local fish online at a specially designed website and <em>Fixe em Casa</em> will collect orders, liaise with the fishermen to purchase the fish in the Sesimbra auction and deliver it.</p>;PT;Business
610;Vianapesca: successful product placement;<p>Vianapesca, a producer organisation (PO) of small-scale and medium-sized fishing fleet operators from Northern Portugal, developed a marketing campaign to promote traditional seafood at national and European level. In 2013, in partnership with other Portuguese POs, Vianapesca opened a traditional canned fish store selling a range of local products in Lisbon. The following year, their Portuguese canned fish found its way to a gourmet grocery in Paris. These successes help to increase incomes and improve living conditions in Portugal's traditional fishing communities.</p>;PT;Business
616;Visiting Vega fishing port: guided tours and education;<p>With the help of the EU, a fishermen's organisation (cofradía) from Spain's Asturias has worked to increase the touristic and cultural value of the local fisheries sector by equipping the local auction house for guided tours and educational activities. The project team developed an interactive route around the local auction house allowing visitors to learn about and experience the daily work of local fishermen. The project has gained wide coverage in national media and become an important tourist attraction in the area.</p>;ES;Business
619;Pesca-tourism: experiencing fishing and aquaculture in the Arcachon Bay;<p>EU support allowed an inter-municipal body in France to bring together fishermen, shellfish farmers and tourist operators in order to develop and promote fisheries and aquaculture as a new eco-tourism package. This has helped re-brand the area's identity and attract more tourists to the area. A quality charter ensures a coherent and qualitative offer. Direct support, including training, was also provided to fishermen and aquaculture producers to start accepting tourists on board their boats.</p>;FR;Business
620;Carp tourism: guided tours by carp experts;<p>The Aischgrund Carp Region in Germany used EU support to bring together around 1 000 carp producers in a concerted effort to develop and promote carp tourism in the area. An info point was set up, packages of activities organised and 'carp guides' trained. Local carp farmers were specially trained to accompany tourists on guided walks through the long belts of ponds, on bus excursions and on visits to the local carp museum. These activities are offered alongside broader tourism activities such as bicycle tours and city sightseeing tours.</p>;DE;Business
621;Wave Restaurant: set up by a fisherman;<p>In order to allow for fish reproduction, many of the fishing grounds of Kalymnos Island are closed during the summer months. With the help of EU a small-scale Greek fisherman, Kostas Pizanias, set up a restaurant to complement his revenue and serve his freshly caught fish. His restaurant is now employing him and two employees over the summer, allowing him to sell his reduced summer catch directly to diners in the restaurant, while offering sea views and the touch of waves. 100% of the fish served in the restaurant is local, and 80% is caught by Kostas Pizanias.</p>;GR;Business
623;Diversifying fishing net mending: sport fishing accessories and handcraft shop;<p>Net menders in Asturias have seized EU support to diversify their traditional activities of net mending and tap into new markets (training and tourism). They now also make by hand and sell various artisanal products, including rugs, brooches, football nets and placemats. Moreover, in order to preserve the activity of net mending, they have organised training courses aimed at attracting young people towards the secrets and techniques behind this traditional activity. Besides the training, visits are organised for tourists around the shop explaining their work.</p>;ES;Business
626;Sand Extraction and Transport: servicing shellfish production;<p>Nuno Russo comes from a family of Portuguese shellfish producers in Ria Formosa, Algarve. EU support has enabled him and his family to diversify their business and develop a new service for their fellow producers. Shellfish farmers need to mix sand and gravel in ideal proportions and frequently need to add one or another, which requires lengthy and heavy extraction and transport operations. To transform this challenge into an opportunity, Nuno Russo decided to design a specially adapted boat, fitted with a crane and a transport barge, which eases production operations.</p>;PT;Business
632;Business mentoring and coaching in the fishing sector;<p>The EU-funded EMPREAMAR project provides business mentoring, coaching and financial support to local and unemployed people from the fisheries sector in order to encourage the creation of new businesses in or related to the sector. The training is on project development, viability assessment, communication and social media strategy. Successful participants received personalised advice or mentoring and, in some cases, the necessary premises to start their activities.</p>;ES;Business
634;Portuguese fisherman gets a new life as an aquaculture producer;<p>In Portugal, the global economic crisis had severe impacts on employment and many people lost their jobs. João Franco Santos was one of them. Previously employed by a public administration, the European Fisheries Fund helped him start a new life as an aquaculture entrepreneur. He partnered with a retired fisherman to help him navigate the sector and advise him throughout the project. The fisheries local action group (FLAG) supported João to apply for funding to acquire the equipment needed. It also helped him develop a network with experienced entities in the area.</p>;PT;Business
950;Transfer of an innovative training approach for ecological cleaning (EcoCleaner);<p>Working hours in the cleaning sector, circumstances around the job as well as the contracts provided may result in a lack of awareness of the risks associated with cleaning: exposure to dangerous ingredients and to hazardous substances, psychosocial issues and health problems. The project EcoCleaner put emphasis on the adaptation, further development and transfer of existing innovative training curricula for cleaning staff towards 'green' and safe cleaning. The project also addressed private and public employers of cleaning staff.</p>;LU;Education & training

5487;Restoration and creation of spawning areas for salmon and trout in Testeboån river;<p>Until recently, Testeboån river was very inhospitable to wild migratory fish like salmon. In order to reintroduce a wild, self-sustaining salmon population, one condition was that the fish would be able to move up and down the river. To achieve this, waterways and spawning grounds were restored. The hydraulic power plants on the river were equipped to offer safe passage from their turbines and to guarantee sufficient water levels compatible with fish migration.</p>;SE;Fisheries and Maritime Affairs
