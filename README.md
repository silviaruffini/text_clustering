# Text clustering with Python and Dash 

Text Clustering analysis usually involves the Text Mining process to turn text into structured data for analysis, via application of natural language processing (NLP) and analytical methods.
In this project  it is described the process to classify and visualize meaningful textual contents of European Union projects into topics clusters.
The steps developed for this process are:
<ul>
<li> <strong><em>Pre- processig Text</em></strong> with spaCy (https://spacy.io/);</li>
<li><strong><em>Feature extraction</em></strong> with <code>sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidVectorizer</code>;</li>
<li> Build model and Evaluation with  <code>sklearn.metrics </code> and  <code>sklearn.cluster </code>;</li>
<li> <strong><em>Visualization with Dash</strong></em> â€”(Open Source Python library built on top of Flask and Plotly.js);</li>
-</ul>
